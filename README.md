# Object Detection and Tracking with YOLOv8 and ByteTrack

This project focuses on detecting and tracking objects and people within construction sites in real-time.

:exclamation: Due to the notebook's big size, *nbviewer* has been used for rendering instead of uploading the actual file.

## Dataset

The dataset [Construction Site Safety Image Dataset Roboflow](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snehilsanyal/construction-site-safety-image-dataset-roboflow) was used for this project.

## Models

For this project, both the object detection as well as the object tracking model used are implemented by [Ultralytics](https://www.ultralytics.com/)
